#**MPU-9250 sensor module**

MPU9250 is a multi-purpose sensor that is based on the Micro Electro Mechanical Systems architecture (MEMS). The MPU9250 is a 9 DOF real-time motion tracking device. It contains a 3D Gyroscope, 3D magnetometer, and 3D accelerometer. It has a very small high-performance IC that has a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter. This module also has an in-built temperature sensor. This module uses an I2C communication protocol for interfacing with the microcontrollers.

The MPU9250 9-DOF sensor Module can provide acceleration, angle change, and magnetic field on 3 axes x, y, and z with high speed and accuracy. This module also features an in-built temperature sensor that can measure the temperature range between -40 to +85 degrees Celsius.
